\noindent In this doctoral thesis I will present three different searches for new heavy resonances decaying into pairs of vector bosons in the all-hadronic final state. The analyzed data was collected by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) during the first three years of data-taking at a collision center-of-mass energy of 13 \TeV, and the searches were the first of their kind to ever be performed at such a high collision energy. The diboson final states under consideration are challenging to resolve due to the bosons being highly energetic ("boosted"), resulting in the two quarks from the decay being very collimated and get merged into one single jet.

The first search I will present, was one of the two first CMS searches in boosted final states with 13 \TeV data to become published and the first to take advantage of jet substructure on trigger level. It was a high profile analysis due to an observed 3.4(1.3) $\sigma$ excess around 2 \TeV in the 8 \TeV dataset, as analyzed by ATLAS(CMS), and I brought the search to a published results within six months after 13 \TeV data taking began (and within ten months after embarking on my PhD). Through the second analysis I optimized, validated and commissioned the novel PUPPI softdrop jet grooming algorithm for vector boson tagging and, in addition, developed dedicated mass corrections for the softdrop jet mass. The algorithm and corresponding mass corrections are now the default for vector boson tagging in CMS and used by several analyses. It was the first published result taking advantage of PUPPI softdrop jet grooming.The third and final search I will present, introduces a novel multidimensional search framework, which can be used to search for resonances peaking anywhere in the dijet and jet groomed mass spectrum. Validated through a search with hadronically decaying vector bosons in the final state, which I will present here, the framework can be used to incorporate all resonance searches with hadronically decaying vector boson or Higgs boson final states, as well as for generic searches for any boosted object peaking in jet mass.

The future for searches with the multi-dimensional fit framework : A better vector boson tagger, and a generic anti-QCD tagger for signal independent searches. As a side project during my final PhD semester, I worked on a solution for the first, which has the added benefit of being a stepping stone towards the latter. This is what I will cover in the final chapter of this thesis.
