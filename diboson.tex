\section{Search I: First search for diboson resonances at 13 TeV}
\label{searchI}
\textit{
When the LHC started its Run II data taking period in summer 2015, it would be the first time ever for a particle collider to produce collisions with center-of-mass energies of 13 TeV. The Higgs boson for which the LHC was designed to find had been discovered at the end of the previous data taking era, leaving us with a Standard Model that we know is, in the best case, in need of extensions and, in the worst case, an effective theory valid only in a certain energy domain. The Run II search program would therefore be oriented around two main efforts: Precision measurements of the newly discovered Higgs boson and searches for Beyond Standard Model physics.
\newline
\newline
I started my PhD four months before the first 13 TeV collisions took place and had to consider the following:
What was the most interesting search that could be done on a short time scale (to be presented 6 months after first collisions, at the CERN end-of-year "Jamboree"), would be manageable for a student with no previous analysis experience and would be robust enough incase there were issues with the never-before-validated 13 \TeV Monte Carlo?
\newline
\newline
The attention of the high-energy physics community has in the past years been focused on certain "hot topics": In 2018, this was most certainly leptoquarks (driven by a dimuon excess around 30 GeV), in 2016 and 2017 is was diphoton resonances (with  $>3\sigma$ excesses observed both in ATLAS and in CMS). And in 2015 during the 13 \TeV LHC start-up, attention was centered on diboson resonances in the all-hadronic final state. The choice was therefore clear: My first analysis would be a search for diboson resonances in the boosted dijet final state. With a background model based on a smooth fit to data in the signal region, eliminating the need for accurate QCD MC predictions, this was a simple one-background only (QCD) analysis, feasible for a first-year PhD student to finalize within a year. Despite its straightforwardness, due to observed 8 TeV excesses, it was in addition considered a high-profile analysis.
\newline
\newline
This search became one of the first "boosted" searches published with 13 \TeV data as well as the first search to take advantage of dedicated "grooming" (see Section~\ref{sec:objreco:grooming}) triggers.

\section{Search II: A new pileup resistant and perturbative safe tagger}
\label{searchII}
\textit{
With the first 13 \TeV diboson resonance search published, we could conclude that more data would be needed in order to fully exclude the observed Run 1 excess. Luckily, 2016 was right around the corner and, with the LHC planning to reduce $\beta^*$ from 80 \cm to 40, the machine was expected to deliver an instantaneous luminosity three times that of the 2015 peak luminosity. Higher instantaneous luminosity, however, meant double the pileup.
\newline
\newline
We knew that a novel pileup subtraction algorithm had been developed, which provided far better pileup and underlying event rejection than the current default (CHS). We also knew that there had been made progress on the theory side in the development of a groomer which was insensitive to the soft divergences of QCD and allowed to accomplish jet grooming in a theoretically calculable way, SoftDrop (mMDT). With more time at hand than in 2015, I therefore decided to pursue a novel W-tagger for this second search. This included work like optimization, development of dedicated jet mass corrections (in use today and recommended by the jet physics object group) as well as validation of the new tagger. The tagger, together with the mass corrections, afterwards became the default W-tagging algorithm in CMS.
\newline
\newline
Search II became the first published analysis to use the novel PUPPI+softdrop algorithm, now default for W-tagging in CMS. Through this search, the tagger was optimized, commissioned and validated, making it available for several analysis to come. In addition, the search was extended to setting limits on three additional signal hypothesis. Two of these were in a final state never before explored at 13 \TeV, the $\textrm{q}^* \rightarrow \textrm{qV}$ single V-tag analyses.

\section{Search III: A novel framework for multi-dimensional searches}
\label{searchIII}
\textit{
After two successful analyses of 13 TeV data, no excess had been observed in the all-hadronic VV channels. The available phase space for New Physics to hide out was shrinking and we saw two ways forward: Either look for deviations from the Standard Model through precision measurements that would allow searching for resonances currently out of LHC reach, or deplete the number of places New Physics could be hiding as efficiently and completely as possible.
With a solid background in searches with boosted final states, we decided for the latter. Our idea was the following: What if the small excesses observed in VV final states were due to us catching the tail of another type of boson with a mass slightly different from that of a \PW or a \PZ boson? And what if we were seeing cascade decays, where the jets in questions were actually four-prong like rather than two?........TODO
