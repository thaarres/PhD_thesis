\chapter{Search I: First search for diboson resonances at 13 TeV}
\label{searchI}
\textit{
\noindent When the LHC started its Run II data taking period in summer 2015, it would be the first time ever for a particle collider to produce collisions with center-of-mass energies as high as 13 \TeV. The Higgs boson, for which the LHC was designed to observe, had been discovered at the end of the previous data taking era, leaving us with a Standard Model that we know is either in need of extensions or only an effective theory valid in a certain energy domain. The Run II search program would therefore be oriented around two main efforts: Precision measurements of the newly discovered Higgs boson and searches for physics beyond the standard model.
\newline
\newline
I started my PhD four months before the first 13 TeV collisions took place and had to consider the following:
What was the most interesting search that could be done on a short time scale (to be presented 6 months after first collisions, which would be at the CERN end-of-year "Jamboree"), whose physics objects could be reconstructed and understood on a relatively short time scale, and would be robust enough in case there were issues with the never-before-validated 13 \TeV Monte Carlo?
\newline
\newline
The attention of the high-energy physics community has in the past years been focused on certain "hot topics": In 2018 and currently in 2019, the excitement is over leptoquarks, which could explain anomalies observed by LHCb and b-factories; in 2016 and 2017 it was diphoton resonances, with $>3 \sigma$ excesses observed at the same mass in both CMS and ATLAS. And in 2015 during the 13 \TeV LHC start-up, attention was centered on diboson resonances in the all-hadronic final state. The choice was therefore clear: My first analysis would be a search for diboson resonances in the boosted dijet final state. With a background model based on a smooth fit to data in the signal region, eliminating the need for accurate QCD MC predictions, this was a simple one-background only (QCD) analysis, feasible to finalize in one year, given dedication and sufficient effort. Despite its straightforwardness, due to observed 8 TeV excesses, it was in addition considered a high-profile analysis.
\newline
\newline
This search became one of the first "boosted" searches published with data collected with a 13 TeV center-of-mass energy, as well as the first search to take advantage of dedicated "grooming" triggers. It was published with 2.7 \fbinv of 2015 data.

\chapter{Search II: A new pileup resistant and perturbative safe tagger}
\label{searchII}
\textit{
\noindent With the first 13 \TeV diboson resonance search published, we could conclude that more data would be needed in order to fully exclude the observed Run 1 excess. Luckily, 2016 was right around the corner and, with the LHC planning to reduce $\beta^*$ from 80 \cm to 40, the machine was expected to deliver an instantaneous luminosity three times that of the 2015 peak luminosity. Higher instantaneous luminosity, however, meant double the pileup.
\newline
\newline
We knew that a novel pileup subtraction algorithm had been developed, which provided far better pileup and underlying event rejection than the current default (CHS). We also knew that there had been made progress on the theory side in the development of a groomer which was insensitive to the soft divergences of QCD and allowed to accomplish jet grooming in a theoretically calculable way, SoftDrop (mMDT). With more time at hand than in 2015, I therefore decided to pursue a novel W-tagger for this second search. This included work like optimization, development of dedicated jet mass corrections (in use today and recommended by the jet physics object group) as well as validation of the new tagger. The tagger, together with the mass corrections, afterwards became the default W-tagging algorithm in CMS.
\newline
\newline
Search II became the first published analysis to use the novel PUPPI softdrop grooming algorithm, now default for W-tagging in CMS. Through this search, the tagger was optimized, commissioned and validated, making it available for several analysis to come. In addition, the search was extended to setting limits on three additional signal hypothesis. Two of these were in a final state never before explored at 13 \TeV, the $\textrm{q}^* \rightarrow \textrm{qV}$ single V-tag analyses. Published with 35.9(12.9) \fbinv of 2016 data.

\chapter{Search III: A novel framework for multi-dimensional searches}
\label{searchIII}
\textit{
After two successful analyses of 13 TeV data, no excess had confirmed the 8 \TeV bump and the available phase space for New Physics to hide out was shrinking. However, this fact was not a source of concern to everybody. On the BSM theory front, ideas were simmering about whether it was possible that the small bumps we were observing in the dijet invariant mass spectrum were due to us catching the tail of another type of boson with a mass slightly different from that of a \PW or a \PZ boson. And that perhaps these jets were not 2-prong objects, but in reality 4-prong.
\newline
\newline
With Run 2 coming to and end, marking the beginning of a two year long shut-down, it was time to think about how we could probe alternative BSM models as effectively as possible. Our idea was therefore the following: We would build a novel framework capable of easily scanning the full softdrop jet mass and N-prong spectrum, and which, in addition, would lead to a gain in sensitivity for the standard VV all-hadronic search. We would do this by taking advantage of the fact that we were looking for bumps in a three-dimensional space: the softdrop mass of the two jets as well as their invariant mass. As a validation of the method, the method would be demonstrated in the context of the VV all-hadronic search, replacing the dijet fit method. We would then extend this to simultaneously search for resonances decaying to W(qq), Z(qq) and H(qq) and, finally, take full advantage of the framework and look for generic resonances peaking anywhere in the jet mass and dijet invariant mass spectrum.
\newline
\newline
Search III introduces a novel three-dimensional search method, allowing to simultaneously search for W/Z/H signals, and eventually non-SM bosons, in the softdrop jet mass spectrum. It is the first analysis to measure the jet mass scale and resolution simultaneously from a W(qq)+jets and Z(qq)+jets mass peak. Published with the full 2016+2017 dataset, $\sim 80 \fbinv$.}
