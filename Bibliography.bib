  abstract={The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is a hermetic, fine grained, homogeneous calorimeter, containing 75,848 lead tungstate scintillating crystals. We highlight the key role of the ECAL in the discovery and elucidation of the Standard Model Higgs boson during LHC Run I. We discuss, with reference to specific examples from LHC Run I, the challenges of operating a crystal calorimeter at a hadron collider. Particular successes, chiefly in terms of achieving and maintaining the required detector energy resolution in the harsh radiation environment of the LHC, are described. The prospects for LHC Run II (starting in 2015) are discussed, building upon the experience gained from Run I. The high luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) is expected to be operational from about 2025 to 2035 and will provide instantaneous and integrated luminosities of around 5 × 10 34 / cm 2 / s and 3000/fb respectively. We outline the challenges that ECAL will face and motivate the evolution of the detector that is thought to be necessary to maintain its performance throughout LHC and High-Luminosity LHC operation.}

  abstract={The LHC is the new CERN hadron accelerator that has recently started to collide proton beams at 7 TeV center of mass energy. It features two general purpose experiments ATLAS and CMS and two specific experiments: LHCb to study b-quark physics and Alice to study heavy ions collisions. Electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters play a crucial role in the ATLAS and CMS experiments. High energy electrons and photons and missing transverse energy are used in most new particle searches. Calorimeters are also used in the experiment trigger. This paper reviews the design of the various electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters employed in the LHC experiments, their commissioning and the first results on the performance with beam.}

abstract="The performance of the CMS hadron calorimeter is studied using test beam facilities at CERN. Two wedges of brass-scintillator calorimeter are exposed to negative and positive beams with momenta between 3 and 300 GeV/c. Light produced in the scintillators are collected using wavelength shifting fibres and read out using hybrid photodiodes. Each of the wedges has 17 layers of scintillators. In one of these wedges signal from all 17 layers are grouped together while in the other each layer is read out separately. The response, energy resolution, longitudinal and lateral shower profiles are measured.",
