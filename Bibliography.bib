  abstract={The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is a hermetic, fine grained, homogeneous calorimeter, containing 75,848 lead tungstate scintillating crystals. We highlight the key role of the ECAL in the discovery and elucidation of the Standard Model Higgs boson during LHC Run I. We discuss, with reference to specific examples from LHC Run I, the challenges of operating a crystal calorimeter at a hadron collider. Particular successes, chiefly in terms of achieving and maintaining the required detector energy resolution in the harsh radiation environment of the LHC, are described. The prospects for LHC Run II (starting in 2015) are discussed, building upon the experience gained from Run I. The high luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) is expected to be operational from about 2025 to 2035 and will provide instantaneous and integrated luminosities of around 5 × 10 34 / cm 2 / s and 3000/fb respectively. We outline the challenges that ECAL will face and motivate the evolution of the detector that is thought to be necessary to maintain its performance throughout LHC and High-Luminosity LHC operation.}

  abstract={The LHC is the new CERN hadron accelerator that has recently started to collide proton beams at 7 TeV center of mass energy. It features two general purpose experiments ATLAS and CMS and two specific experiments: LHCb to study b-quark physics and Alice to study heavy ions collisions. Electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters play a crucial role in the ATLAS and CMS experiments. High energy electrons and photons and missing transverse energy are used in most new particle searches. Calorimeters are also used in the experiment trigger. This paper reviews the design of the various electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters employed in the LHC experiments, their commissioning and the first results on the performance with beam.}

abstract = "A progressive recognition of charged particle trajectories is proposed: starting from a small segment, the tracks are extended by adding points one after another; the fitted parameters of the trajectory are updated at the same time (using a Kalman-like formalism), thus giving an increasing precision no the prediction to the next point. This method was implemented in the DELPHI TPC off-line analysis: a flexible strategy is associated with this general principle in order to cope with specific problems (overlap and edge effects, error tails, etc.). A generalization of the method to more general configurations of tracking devices is proposed."

  abstract={The CMS apparatus was identified, a few years before the start of the LHC operation at CERN, to feature properties well suited to particle-flow (PF) reconstruction: a highly-segmented tracker, a fine-grained electromagnetic calorimeter, a hermetic hadron calorimeter, a strong magnetic field, and an excellent muon spectrometer. A fully-fledged PF reconstruction algorithm tuned to the CMS detector was therefore developed and has been consistently used in physics analyses for the first time at a hadron collider. For each collision, the comprehensive list of final-state particles identified and reconstructed by the algorithm provides a global event description that leads to unprecedented CMS performance for jet and hadronic τ decay reconstruction, missing transverse momentum determination, and electron and muon identification. This approach also allows particles from pileup interactions to be identified and enables efficient pileup mitigation methods. The data collected by CMS at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV show excellent agreement with the simulation and confirm the superior PF performance at least up to an average of 20 pileup interactions.}

  abstract={The bremsstrahlung energy loss distribution of electrons propagating in matter is highly non-Gaussian. Because the Kalman filter relies solely on Gaussian probability density functions, it is not necessarily the optimal reconstruction algorithm for electron tracks. A Gaussian-sum filter (GSF) algorithm for electron reconstruction in the CMS tracker has therefore been developed and implemented. The basic idea is to model the bremsstrahlung energy loss distribution by a Gaussian mixture rather than by a single Gaussian. It is shown that the GSF is able to improve the momentum resolution of electrons compared to the standard Kalman filter. The momentum resolution and the quality of the error estimate are studied both with a fast simulation, modelling the radiative energy loss in a simplified detector, and the full CMS tracker simulation.}

  abstract={The performance of muon reconstruction, identification, and triggering in CMS has been studied using 40 pb −1 of data collected in pp collisions at √ s = 7 TeV at the LHC in 2010. A few benchmark sets of selection criteria covering a wide range of physics analysis needs have been examined. For all considered selections, the efficiency to reconstruct and identify a muon with a transverse momentum p T larger than a few GeV/c is above 95% over the whole region of pseudorapidity covered by the CMS muon system, |η| < 2.4, while the probability to misidentify a hadron as a muon is well below 1%. The efficiency to trigger on single muons with p T above a few GeVc is higher than 90% over the full η range, and typically substantially better. The overall momentum scale is measured to a precision of 0.2% with muons from Z decays. The transverse momentum resolution varies from 1% to 6% depending on pseudorapidity for muons with p T below 100GeV/c and, using cosmic rays, it is shown to be better than 10% in the central region up to p T = 1 TeV/c. Observed distributions of all quantities are well reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulation.}

abstract="N -subjettiness is a jet shape designed to identify boosted hadronic objects such as top quarks. Given N subjet axes within a jet, N-subjettiness sums the angular distances of jet constituents to their nearest subjet axis. Here, we generalize and improve on N -subjettiness by minimizing over all possible subjet directions, using a new variant of the k-means clustering algorithm. On boosted top benchmark samples from the BOOST2010 workshop, we demonstrate that a simple cut on the 3-subjettiness to 2-subjettiness ratio yields 20{\%} (50{\%}) tagging efficiency for a 0.23{\%} (4.1{\%}) fake rate, making N -subjettiness a highly effective boosted top tagger. N-subjettiness can be modified by adjusting an angular weighting exponent, and we find that the jet broadening measure is preferred for boosted top searches. We also explore multivariate techniques, and show that additional improvements are possible using a modified Fisher discriminant. Finally, we briefly mention how our minimization procedure can be extended to the entire event, allowing the event shape N-jettiness to act as a fixed N cone jet algorithm.",

The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics."

Diboson resonances with masses in the range from 1.3 to 3.0 TeV are sought after using the invariant mass distribution of dijets where both jets are tagged as a boson jet, compatible with a highly boosted W or Z boson decaying to quarks, using jet mass and substructure properties. The largest deviation from a smoothly falling background in the observed dijet invariant mass distribution occurs around 2 TeV in the WZ channel, with a global significance of 2.5 standard deviations. Exclusion limits at the 95{\%} confidence level are set on the production cross section times branching ratio for the WZ final state of a new heavy gauge boson, W{\textasciiacutex}, and for the WW and ZZ final states of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the graviton in a bulk Randall-Sundrum model, as a function of the resonance mass. W{\textasciiacutex} bosons with couplings predicted by the extended gauge model in the mass range from 1.3 to 1.5 TeV are excluded at 95{\%} confidence level.",
