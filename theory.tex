\section{The Standard Model Lagrangian}
Everything this thesis is built on, has its roots in the Standard Model. The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) adresses the question \emph{What is matter made of?} on the smallest possible scale. It maps the fundamental constituents of the universe together through the forces that bind them, hoping to provide a complete picture of the laws of nature.
\subsection{Particles and fields}
It appears that the universe can be described by a very small collection of fundamental particles, six leptons and six quarks. These are collectively called fermions and are, as far as we can tell, truly elementary (not composed of any other particles). They come in three generations, based on their mass

% Leptons are observed to exist with integral or zero electric charge as defined in units of the charge of the electron.  There are three flavors of leptons forming a progressive mass hierarchy in a doublet \index{lepton!flavor!doublets} arranged structure whereby each charged lepton is associated with a light, neutrally charged particle denoted as a \index{neutrino} \index{lepton!neutrino|see{neutrino}} neutrino,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:lepton_flavor_doublets}
\begin{pmatrix} e       \\ \nu_e      \end{pmatrix} \qquad
\begin{pmatrix} \mu     \\ \nu_{\mu}  \end{pmatrix} \qquad
\begin{pmatrix} \tau    \\ \nu_{\tau} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
